### MetaMask Snaps Introduction
Snap is a system that allows developers to build and expand the capabilities of MetaMask safely. It is a program run in an isolated environment with limited capabilities that can customize and modify MetaMask's wallet experience for end users. For example, a snap can add new APIs to MetaMask, thus adding support for different blockchains or change existing functionalities using internal APIs.

Additional information can be found [here](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html).
